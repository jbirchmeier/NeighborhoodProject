Udacity Front End nanodegree mini-project
This is the fifth of six projects for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program. 
In one.html you will see a map based application for the Logan Square neighborhood in Chicago, IL USA. I compiled a short list of my favorite places in the neighborhood and stored them in neighborhood.json. Viewmodel.js incorporates these locations in to the google maps api and a searchable list created using knockout.js. 

To use the application: 
-You can search by name in the search bar and see a filtered list and filtered map markers
-Once you click on a list item or a map marker, an infowindow will give you more detailed information about this particular location

To contribute: 
If you live/love Logan Square and want to add your favorite spots, go ahead and include it in the json library!
